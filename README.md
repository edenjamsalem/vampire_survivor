# Vampire Survivor Game

This is a simple 2D shooter game, where the player has to avoid touching the enemies and kill as many of them as possible before dying!

See how long you can survive!

## Key features

The base game logic was built following this [pygame course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OMghdHP-zs&t=26863s). 
However many new features have been added:

- The player has 3 lives instead of 1
- There is a simple homescreen & gameover screen
- A txt file is used to save the high score between games
- Powerups spawn around the map, some temporarily upgrade the player's weapon, others increase his speed, slow down nearby enemies, plant mines and so on... 
- A Boss spawns every minute with increased health, shooting projectiles towards the player. Any direct contact with the boss is instant death ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
